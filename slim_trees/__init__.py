"""
This module changes the default pickle behavior. Instead of using pickle.dump to pickle an object,
you can create a custom Pickler and change the default pickling behavior for certain classes by
changing the dispatch_table of the pickler.
TODO: Update this docstring
In this module, a custom pickling behavior for the sklearn Tree class is specified that compresses
the internal values from int64 to int16 and from float64 to float32 (in the value field) and from
float64 to a mixture between float64 and int16 (in the threshold field).
You can pickle a model with custom picklers by specifying dump_function in dump_compressed in the
pickling module.
